**What am I seeing here?**

This heatmap summarises the average Deuterium uptake of <span style="color:red">protection</span> and <span style="color:blue">deprotection</span> probabilities per residue in the sequence of HOIP-RBR, per each single-domain antibody tested for binding, alongside the _apo_ (unbound) states (vertical axis). The common epitopes in HOIP-RBR are identified for the range of binding antibodies.

Note that 

* For convenience <span style="color:blue">deprotected</span> probabilities were multiplied by `-1` to centre the blue-white-red colourmap at zero.

* The heatmap data here was computed from averaging the heatmap data in _Figure 4_ (leftmost panel) in Reference [1] which shows the intensity of protection/deprotection but at the peptide level. Note that for the _apo state_ our heatmap similarly shows zero intensity along the residue sequence too.

* Colour coding in the _Sequence Viewer_ and for each row here are identical.
