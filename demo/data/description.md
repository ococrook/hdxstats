**Why this visualiser?**

* This visualiser is meant to complement the results in Reference [1] by providing an interactive way of exploring the data therein.

* Given the structure of HOIP-RBR (PDB id:[`5edv`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5edv)) [2], this visualiser colours estimated regions <span style="color:red">protected</span> or <span style="color:blue">deprotected</span> from Deuterium uptake in Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange (HDX) experiments.

**How to use this visualiser**

* By using the control panel on the left you highlight those residues in HOIP-RBR protected/deprotected from HDX upon binding to each single-domain _Antibody_, which you can select via the dropdown menu.

* You can also explore different _Representations_ to gain a better sense of how HDX protection/deprotection relates to secondary structure, surface accessibility, and so on.

* The _Sequence Viewer_ at the bottom dynamically highlights the residue numbers involved in  HDX protection or deprotection upon selecting an antibody. The amino-acid identities and estimated protection/deprotection probabilities are shown too per each residue.

* You can also vary the colour-scale limits values to explore what parts in HOIP-RBR get highlighted according to their
protection/deprotection intensity. _Note_ values outside the scale limits will automatically highlight residues in grey.
